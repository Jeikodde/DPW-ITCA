        <img src="../images/java-logo.svg" alt="JAVA logo" class="img">
        <h3 class="bold-text">JAVA</h3>
        <p><span class="bold-text">Java</span> is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language designed for platform independence. It can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is commonly used for web applications, mobile apps (especially Android), enterprise software, and embedded systems.</p>

        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <dl>
          <dt class="bold-text">Cross-platform compatibility</dt>
          <dd>Java is known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy, meaning it can run on any platform that supports Java (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).</dd>

          <dt class="bold-text">Large ecosystem and libraries</dt>
          <dd>Java has a rich set of libraries and frameworks for various development needs (e.g., Spring, Hibernate).</dd>

          <dt class="bold-text">Strong community and support</dt>
          <dd>Java has been around for decades, so it has a vast developer community and extensive resources.</dd>
        </dl>

        <dl>
          <dt class="bold-text">Verbose syntax</dt>
          <dd>Java can be more verbose compared to languages like Python or JavaScript, which may slow down development.</dd>

          <dt class="bold-text">Slower startup time</dt>
          <dd>Java applications can take longer to start compared to other languages due to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) initialization.</dd>

          <dt class="bold-text">Memory consumption</dt>
          <dd>Java applications can be memory-intensive, particularly for large-scale systems.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h4>Costs</h4>
        <dl>
          <dt class="bold-text">Development</dt>
          <dd>Java itself is free and open-source, but you may need commercial licenses for certain tools or platforms (e.g., Oracle JDK).</dd>

          <dt class="bold-text">Hosting</dt>
          <dd>Hosting Java applications can be more expensive due to the higher resource usage and the need for specialized environments like application servers.</dd>
